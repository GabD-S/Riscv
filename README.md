# RISC-V Labs

This repository now organizes laboratory materials under the directory ./LAB1_content for Lab 1.

Structure:

- LAB1_content/
  - Arquivos/ (source assembly, C sources, test cases, RARS jar)
  - relatorio.tex (lab report LaTeX)
  - OAC_LAB1.pdf (original instructions)
  - README.md (lab-specific guide)

Next steps:
- Future labs can be placed as LAB2_content/, LAB3_content/ etc.
- Keep reports named relatorio.tex inside each lab folder.

Conventions:
- Follow Conventional Commits.
- Use UTF-8 and Portuguese babel in LaTeX.
